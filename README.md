Trying to write a snake style game in fast period of time.

Snake game with multiple apples (they can stack on same space :( ), growing snaek on a wrapping plane that has a hit stop animation for when it contacts itself.Apples still spawn during hitstop.

Movement keys are arrows and wasd.
No pause.
No quit.
